# Web-Scrapper-Selenium-and-Beautful-Soup
This project is a coding sample for a Company. My main objective here is to scrape data from a website and store it in a csv file.


Things to do to get started: 

<li> Git Clone the Repo. For the convinence I have added the Geckodriver. Make sure you install the gecko driver on this project drirectory.</li>
<li> Once it is cloned, go inside the project and install all the dependencies. ( pip install -r requirement.txt.) 
<li> After the installation, go to the terminal, navigate to project directory, and run ( python index.py) </li>
<li> The progam should run sucessfully. Bingo! you get data scraped from a website in csv file </li>
